# LED_Clock
A CH32V003 low cost 'night clock'<br>
The PCB project was created with KiCad 7.0 and the firmware in the MounRiver Studio IDE. The target device is the TSSOP20 version of the CH32V003.

<b>Why did you make it?</b><br>
We like to sleep in a completely black room with no LEDs visible. In the winter, the sun comes up later in the morning and it's useful to know what time it is if you wake up too early and can try to sleep a bit more. My idea was to create an LED clock which displays the time in the day and goes completely black at night. To display the time in a dark room, you wave your hand close to the clock and it will dimly display the time for a few seconds.<br>

The KiCad project files and gerbers (ready to produce at your favorite PCB fab) are in the PCB folder.<br>
